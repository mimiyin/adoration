daily refrain
disembodied face
to
disembodied face
harder to understand
closer attention
reduced
a portrait of yourself
unrestrained attentiveness
censoring
invisible signs
I don't know what
more intimate
a physical embrace
illusion
Can you say something?
glitching
dropped frames
delay
delete 
pay attention
understand
What?
I don't know.
